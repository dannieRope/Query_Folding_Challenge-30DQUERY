## Power Query Folding Challenge

It is part of my goals this month, October 2023, to learn M code to help me clean and transform data in power query effectively and at ease.
Finding a resources for me was not an easy one until I found this challenge #30DQUERY on twitter(X) initiated by @notaboutthecell. 

The #30DQUERY challenge is about power query folding. But what does the power query folding mean?

## What is Power Query Folding?

According to Microsoft.com, query folding is the ability for a Power Query to generate a single query statement to retrieve and transform source data.

Power Query's Mashup engine creates the SQL statement by combining all the M statements behind the transformation.

Power folding can be done using the click function or by clicking on the transformation feature in the power query UI. However, for the purpose of learning M code, I decided to spend my time in the advanced query editor writing M code to solve the problems.

Every M code written is properly documented. Click [here](PowerQuerMScripts) to access the scripts.
